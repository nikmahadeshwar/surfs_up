# surfs_up

## Overview
This project explores an analyis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, summary statistics of temperature for the months of June and December, in order to determine if a prospective surf and ice cream shop business can operate sustainably year-round.

## Results

Key Differences in Weather: Oahu, Hawaii

The average recorded temperature in June is about 75 degree F, 4 degrees higher than the average temp in December.
That shows a -5% change in average temperature from June to December
The frequency of temperatures recorded in June tends to have a much more normal, tight bell curve distribution, cooroborated by the smaller std measure of June temps vs December temps
The December temperatures seem to be more variable than those in June given its larger range in recorded temperatures.
The plotted distribution of Dec Temps shows that the median temperature in Dec is more around the average, and there are not many outliers skuing the average temperature higher or lower than the actual recorded frequency.

## Summary
The temperatures recorded in December seem to vary more than those of June. December provides appropriate weather conditions for surfing and demand in ice cream. The average temperatures in June and December differ by 4 degrees, and looking at the December histogram, December's median temperature, with the highest frequency recorded across a span of years, is about 72 degrees, at least double the frequency of the next highest recorded temperatures, 75 and 67 respectively. It would be ill advised to not open the surf and ice cream shop based on at first clance temperature minimums.
